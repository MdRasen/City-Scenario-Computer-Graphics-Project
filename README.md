# City-Scenario-Computer-Graphics-Project
Computer has become a powerful tool for the rapid and economical production of pictures. Computer Graphics remains one the most exciting and rapidly growing fields. It is natural to expect that graphical communication will often be more convenient when computers are utilized for this purpose. In our project, we implemented a city life where day and night view has been drawn. There are many features in day and night view, which can be done by pressing a keyboard button in the city view. Altogether it would render an eye-pleasing city view scenario. Our program provides a fast and accurate rendering of the objects as well as a landscape to simulate a city view.
